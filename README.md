# Vite Project

This project is built using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), a fast and modern build tool optimized for frontend development.

## Project Structure

The project follows the standard structure for a Vite-based application:

```
root
├── public/          # Static assets served as-is at the root URL
├── src/             # Source code directory
├── .gitignore       # Files and directories to ignore in Git
├── README.md        # Documentation for the project
├── eslint.config.js # ESLint configuration file
├── index.html       # Main HTML file
├── package.json     # Node.js project configuration and dependencies
├── package-lock.json# Lockfile for reproducible installs
└── vite.config.js   # Vite configuration file
```

### Key Files and Directories

- **`public/`**: Contains static assets (e.g., images, icons) that are directly accessible in the browser.
- **`src/`**: Contains the main application code, including components, styles, and utilities.
- **`index.html`**: Entry HTML file where the application is mounted.
- **`vite.config.js`**: Configuration file for customizing Vite's behavior.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 16 or higher recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Development

Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start a local development server. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the URL shown in your terminal).

### Build

To build the project for production:
```bash
npm run build
```

The output files will be generated in the `dist/` directory.

### Preview

To preview the production build:
```bash
npm run preview
```

This will serve the files from the `dist/` directory locally.

## Linting

Run ESLint to check for code quality issues:
```bash
npm run lint
```

## Customization

### Vite Configuration
Modify the `vite.config.js` file to customize the Vite build process. For example, you can configure plugins, aliases, and server options.

### Dependencies
Manage project dependencies in `package.json`. Use the following commands:
- Add a dependency: `npm install <package-name>`
- Add a dev dependency: `npm install <package-name> --save-dev`
